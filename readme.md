# **VibraForge: A Scalable Prototyping Toolkit For Creating Spatialized Vibrotactile Feedback Systems** #
This repository shares the open-source design files of the VibraForge toolkit, including mechanical design, electrical design, software design, and GUI editor. 

In Nov 2024, we are planning to ship out several **free** Dev Kit to people who are interested in using the toolkit for their own project. If you are thinking about integrating haptic feedback into your research, fill out this [Google form](https://forms.gle/JLyyHbKHokxcwasP6) and we will get in touch :D

Example applications include:
1. [Phonemic tactile display as an armband](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17420)
2. [Pose correction feedback for virtual reality fitness gaming](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17420)
3. [Collision avoidance feedback for drone teleoperation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12105)

If you encounter any issue while using the toolkit, feel free to submit new issues :D
